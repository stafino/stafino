- 🧑🏼‍🎓 I am pursuing a Msc. in Computer Science at the University of Glasgow (4th year)
- 👨🏼‍💻 I have experience working as a Software Engineer, Automation tester, Mobile App Developer and a Product Owner (I am currently looking for a part-time job)
- 🦾 My hobbies include reading non-fiction books, doing variety of sports (mostly gym atm) and trying to soak as much information on personal finance and to understand how the human body works. I am also a huge fan of Movies and TV Shows, so I've seen almost everything that is out there!
